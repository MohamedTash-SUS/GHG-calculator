        Representing a significant structural evolution from its preceding iteration, this standard methodologically bifurcates the processes of verification, which evaluates historical data, from validation, which assesses assumptions and methods supporting prospective or projected information.`,

            icon: <Target className="w-5 h-5" />,
            content: `This clause establishes the document’s applicability and epistemological boundary. It specifies the principles and requirements for verifying, validating, and performing agreed-upon procedures (AUP) on GHG statements at the organizational, project, and product levels. 
        
        Crucially, the standard is **"regime neutral,"** meaning it functions as a foundational framework that can be applied independently or in conjunction with the specific requirements of any voluntary or mandatory GHG program.`,
            example: `An auditing firm can utilize the ISO 14064-3 framework to verify both a corporate GHG inventory submitted to a national regulatory body and a carbon footprint of a product (CFP) under a voluntary eco-labeling scheme, adjusting specific criteria as dictated by the respective programs.`

            content: `This section constructs the ontological framework necessary for GHG assurance. It sharply distinguishes between a **verification** (evaluating historical data for material correctness) and a **validation** (evaluating the reasonableness of prospective assumptions and methodologies). 
        
        It also defines critical assurance parameters, specifically the **level of assurance** (reasonable or limited, dictating the depth of evidence gathering) and **materiality** (the threshold at which individual or aggregated misstatements could influence the decisions of intended users).`

            icon: <ShieldCheck className="w-5 h-5" />,
            content: `Clause 4 delineates the core ethical and methodological tenets that must govern the behavior of the assurance practitioner. These include impartiality, fair presentation, proper documentation, an evidence-based approach, and conservativeness.`,
            example: `When assessing highly uncertain methodologies, applying the principle of conservativeness requires the validator to utilize a cautiously moderate approach, ensuring that baseline emissions are not artificially inflated, which would result in an overestimation of a project's future emission reductions.`

            content: `This clause consolidates the operational requirements shared across all engagement types. It dictates that prior to commencing, the practitioner must execute pre-engagement activities, explicitly agreeing with the client on the engagement type, level of assurance, objectives, criteria, scope, and materiality thresholds. 
        
        It mandates the selection of a competent team and outlines acceptable evidence-gathering activities, including observation, inquiry, analytical testing, recalculation, and tracing data trails.`,
            example: `If the verification objective requires a reasonable level of assurance, the verifier must design rigorous analytical tests and extensive data tracing protocols to reduce the verification risk to an acceptably low level, as opposed to relying predominantly on inquiry, which might suffice for a limited assurance engagement.`

            title: 'Clause 6: Verification',
            icon: <Search className="w-5 h-5" />,
            content: `Clause 6 constitutes the procedural core for evaluating historical GHG statements. It mandates a strictly sequenced approach:
        
        **Planning (6.1):** The verifier must perform a strategic analysis to understand the organization's complexity, which subsequently informs a comprehensive risk assessment. The verifier must identify inherent risks, control risks, and detection risks. This risk profile dictates the evidence-gathering plan, specifying analytical testing, control testing, sampling, and the necessity of site visits.
        
        **Execution (6.2):** The verifier conducts the verification activities according to the established plan, assessing any mid-engagement changes to the GHG statement.
        
        **Completion (6.3):** The verifier evaluates the sufficiency of the evidence gathered, evaluates any identified misstatements against the materiality threshold, and drafts an initial conclusion.`,
            example: `If the risk assessment reveals that a manufacturing facility relies on manual spreadsheet entry for its stationary combustion data (high control risk), the evidence-gathering plan must mandate a site visit and extensive recalculation of raw fuel purchase invoices to mitigate the risk of material misstatement.`
          },
          {
            id: 'clause7',
            title: 'Clause 7: Validation',
            icon: <Clock className="w-5 h-5" />,
            content: `Because validation involves evaluating hypothetical or future scenarios (typically for GHG mitigation projects), Clause 7 provides parallel but distinct methodologies tailored to prospective data.
        
        **Planning (7.1):** The strategic analysis must evaluate potential material misstatements in projections. A critical component is Estimate testing, wherein the validator assesses the appropriateness of the forecast methodology and its underlying assumptions. The validator must rigorously evaluate GHG-related activity characteristics, including the baseline scenario selection, functional equivalence, and secondary effects (leakage).
        
        **Execution (7.2) & Completion (7.3):** The validator executes the plan, rigorously assessing whether the assumptions yield accurate forecasts and ensuring proper disclosure of uncertainties and sensitivities before drafting an opinion.`,
            example: `When validating an afforestation project, the validator must critically evaluate the proposed baseline scenario to ensure the assumption that the land would have remained degraded is plausible, completely hypothetical, and supported by robust regional land-use data.`

            title: 'Clause 8: Independent review',
            icon: <Search className="w-5 h-5" />,
            content: `To maintain the highest levels of quality control and objectivity, the standard mandates an independent review process. An independent reviewer—a competent professional who was not involved in the verification or validation activities—must evaluate the engagement's findings, ensuring the evidence gathered sufficiently supports the proposed conclusion before any formal opinion is issued.`
          },
          {
            id: 'clause9',
            title: 'Clause 9: Issuance of opinion',
            icon: <Award className="w-5 h-5" />,
            content: `This clause governs the formal concluding act of the engagement. Depending on the evidence evaluated and the materiality of any unresolved errors, the verifier or validator must formally issue one of several specific opinion types:
        
        * **Unmodified:** The GHG statement is materially correct and conforms to criteria.
        * **Modified:** The statement is broadly reliable, but contains non-material misstatements, scope limitations, or nonconformities.
        * **Adverse:** The statement contains material and pervasive misstatements or inadequate controls.
        
        *Note: If sufficient appropriate evidence cannot be obtained, the practitioner must systematically disclaim the issuance of an opinion.*`

            icon: <AlertTriangle className="w-5 h-5" />,
            content: `This final clause establishes a contingency protocol for post-engagement discoveries. If new, material information concerning the validated or verified GHG statement comes to light after the issuance of the opinion, the verifier or validator must evaluate it and may need to communicate to the responsible party and other interested parties that reliance on the original opinion may now be compromised.`
